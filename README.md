# PHP Shopping Cart

Simple shopping cart where the user can add items to the shopping cart, view the shopping cart, update the quantities selected and remove an item from the shopping cart altogether. 

The quantity of product that one can add to the cart is based on how much of that product is in stock, in the database. With each addition or subtraction to the quantity of an item in the cart, both the product in stock quantity and product quantity in the cart are updated synergistically.

## Technologies Used
